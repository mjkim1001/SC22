Representative Projects:

1. Developed a numerical weather prediction model using a large-scale data decomposition technique, such as matrix factorization.

2. Implemented least squares polynomial approximation to model the diameter of blood vessels and average blood velocity in aneurysms.

3. Investigated operator approximation techniques in the Sturm-Liouville eigenbasis.
